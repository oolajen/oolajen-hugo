## About

This site is very much under construction right now. 

I'm a technologist by education and profession, but my day to day work is currently focused on running a small coffee shop in West Jakarta area, Green Ville. *Cipto 185 Coffee & Eatery* opened in September 2017 after being on trial for a whole year. The coffee shop name was inspired by street name of the house I grew up in Pematangsiantar, North Sumatera, with my grandparents for 12 years.
